# Traffic-Volume-Prediction
This repository contains codes for prediction future traffic volume using Long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) on Metro-Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset. This is a multivariate time series dataset. So, memory based deep neural network like LSTM and GRU are suitable for predicting future traffic flow

# Dataset Used:
- Metro-Interstate Traffic Volume Dataset
# Task:
- Multivariate time-series predictions
